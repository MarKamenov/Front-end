This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.
You can find the most recent version of this guide here.

Create React App is divided into two packages:

create-react-app is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
react-scripts is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).
You almost never need to update create-react-app itself: it delegates all the setup to react-scripts.

When you run create-react-app, it always creates the project with the latest version of react-scripts so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.

For state management we use Mobx.

Folder Structure
After creation, your project should look like this:

my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    components/
    store/
    assets/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

public/index.html is the page template;
src/index.js or index.ts is the JavaScript entry point.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
