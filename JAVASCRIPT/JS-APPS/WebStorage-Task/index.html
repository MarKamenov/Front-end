 <!--The Ship game

Task description

The computer generates a random number with four different digits
The leftmost digit must not be 0 (zero)
For simplicity called abcd
At each turn the player enters a four-digit number
For simplicity called xyzw
Implement a high-score list
Sheep means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd, but not on the same position
If two such digits exists, the sheep are 2
Ram means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd and it is on the same position * If two such digits exists, the rams are 2
The game continues until the player guesses the number abcd
i.e. has 4 rams
Task implementation

Your task is to create an object, that has 3 methods:

init(playerName, endCallback)
Starts a new game
Generates a new number
playerName is the name of the player in the high-score
endCallback is a function that must be called when the game ends (the player wins)
It is called after the high-score is updated
guess(number)
Available only after init() is invoked
Should throw otherwise
The player makes a guess agains the number
Returns as a result an object in the format:
{ sheep: 3, rams: 1 }
getHighScore(count)
Returns the top count players of the high-score
If count is greater than the total count of players in the high-score, return the actual number of player in the high-score
The returned players are returned in an array, where each player is in the format:
{name: 'Sheep master', score: 5}*/ -->
